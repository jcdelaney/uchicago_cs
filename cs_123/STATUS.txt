Since our project presentation we have been focusing on two main areas. First, we have been trying
to come up with a more robust model for predicting flight price fluctuations. This has proved to
be our biggest problem and the area where we have seen the least progress. So far, every
combination of the factors we isolated in our data has yielded results that were comparable to our
initial 'naive' model which included all factors. The error rate for our predictor has stayed
right around 23% for most of the models we have tried with small decreases when we include only
one or two variables. For all of these models, when looking at the diagnostic plots we observe
patterns which indicate that the assumptions necessary for statistical inference are not being
met. The implication of this is that, as our data currently stands, the factors we have
identified do not appear to be significant factors for predicting the change in flight price. 
We are still trying to think of ways to approach the data from a different angle but so far
we have not found anything that provides a significant boost in performance. 

One of the methods that we pursued was to employ a ridge regression instead of a normal logistic
regression. The ridge regression works by placing a penalty on the size of each coefficient beta 
during the ordinary least squares minimization. The result of this is that we now longer require 
that our factor matrix be of full rank because the term to be inverted in our expression for beta
now includes a linear term. Despite this, we observed the same problems we saw with our logistic
regression. This leads us to believe that we must either find some way to creatively transform
our data either by normalization or new approaches to factors, or by taking an entirely new
approach to the data. That said, we have managed to stumble upon one significant result which
was a fairly striking example of how flight price volatility increases as the departure date gets
nearer. We took the standard deviation of flight prices at day i out for each market, averaged
across markets and then plotted this average standard deviation against days till departure. The
result was a stark linear increase in the volatility as the departure date neared. We see this as
a small victory because we have been able to confirm a pre-existing assumption we had about our
data.

The second area we have been focusing on has been putting ourselves in a position to scale
whatever model we choose to be able to utilize the AWS framework. This has so far involved porting
all of our existing code from R in to python so that we can utilize the mrjob library. In addition
the increased flexibility of python will allow us to work in a language that we are more familiar
with and which has a wider scope of existing libraries. With this in mind, we haven't chosen to
completely abandon R. One of the main problems we have run into porting our code into python has
been managing the memory overhead involved in loading our dataset into memory and then performing
the necessary manipulations. In order to mimic the functionality of R we have begun using the
pandas library for python in order to continue working with our data as a data frame like object.
We are still in the process of learning pandas and, as a result, we are not completely familiar
with best practices for how to create and manipulate data frames. As a result, our python port is
slower than the equivalent R code and we have not yet found a way to get around python throwing a
memory error when we try to generate dummy variables for our regression.
