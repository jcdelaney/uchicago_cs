INSTRUCTIONS
===
The basic work flow for this prototype is get_data.py -> prep_data.py -> logistic.r
Our data is pulled from a private ftp server that contains raw csv files of flight information.
We have included get_data.py so that you can see our script but for security reasons we cannot
post the login information to a public repo.

===
USAGE
===
Assuming that flight_data.db is in the local director we can excecute prep_data.py from the
terminal by running

prep_data.py delta_t

where delta_t is the period of time over which fare difference is calculated. We recommend using
3 as a default value. Values large than 7 can result in very few entries having valid fare
differences

This serves to generate a new database that has all the data required for analysis including the
regressand. Logistic.r can be ran from the terminal to output the classification error of the
generated model. To see more detailed results see the usage section of logistic.r
